The Monkey
=====
![Alt text](patas.jpg)

The leggy monkeys, clocked at 34 miles an hour (55 kilometers an hour). As if on a high-speed biological clock, patas monkeys live fast, reproducing at the earliest age of any Old World monkey. Female patas reach sexual maturity at age two-and-a-half and give birth at three. Babies can survive alone at just six months, though they'll nurse for up to a year. Meanwhile, mothers mate and give birth again, every year. So a patas could be pregnant, nursing a baby, and shepherding a frisky juvenile all at the same time.
